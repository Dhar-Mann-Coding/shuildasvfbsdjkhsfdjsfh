    <h1>Clive</h1>
    <p>Clive Slater is a college teacher of Computer Science.
      <br>He's probably very good at programming, binary and maths stuff.
      <br>Definately went to one of the universities. I don't know what one, why don't you ask him?
      <br><br>He is currently not looking for work but keep an eye on this website in case he is.
      <br>Honestly i don't know anything about him.
      <br>The mark scheme doesn't say anything about the amount of writing.
